# Langauge Learning Resources
A repo full of lists of resources to help learn (human) langauges
[Github Pages](https://cutthroat78.github.io/Langauge-Learning-Resources/)
## To Do
- Sort Oneida links into Oneida (Wisconsin) and Oneida (Canada)
- Make page of common places/websites to find resources on langauges e.g https://www.native-languages.org, https://glosbe.com, https://www.ethnologue.com etc.
- Remove : from headings (I think just looks nicer)
- Make language and non-language sections in pages that need it and sort/add links based of that
